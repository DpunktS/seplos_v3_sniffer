# seplos_v3_sniffer

[www.seplos.com](https://www.seplos.com/)

This package is designed to read the Seplos V3 BMS in a multipack configuration. In the V3 generation, the first BMS acts as a Modbus master while all other BMS act as slaves. In this configuration, it is no longer possible to access the BMS from a third device via Modbus, since two master devices cannot exist in an RS-485 Modbus system. The package passively detects the communication between the devices, which does not disrupt the communication of the individual BMS.

In the YAML, all required data must be inserted/modified.
Every 200 ms, the BMS transmits a new data set. The update interval can be changed (default: 5 seconds).

To establish a connection, pins 1/8 (B), 2/7 (A) and 5 (GND) must be connected to the RS485 adapter of the ESP8622/ESP32. Various RS485 to TTL adapters can be used.

During my tests, I found that the 120 Ohm terminator in the adapter is not necessary. There is also no terminator in the original Seplos V3 USB adapter. If only one BMS is to be read, it is necessary to connect pin 6 (B) to pin 5 (GND) so that the master can send data independently.
